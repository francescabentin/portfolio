          I started on this web development journey because I absolutely üöÄ love  technology. Whether it's writing code, creating cool designs, or solving tech puzzles, I enjoy every bit of web development. Thanks to my solid business üè¢ background, gained while working with big companies like Kimberly-Clark, I'm good at connecting business needs with tech solutions. That means I can build websites that not only look great but also make smart business sense.
